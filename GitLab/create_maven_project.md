package com.example;

import com.example.util.StringUtil;

public class MyWebApp {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Simulate a web request and use StringUtil from the JAR
    String name = "John Doe";
    String reversedName = StringUtil.reverseString(name);
    System.out.println("Reversed name: " + reversedName);
  }
}

Here's a sample Java web application project that uses a JAR dependency:

**Project Structure:**

```
my-web-app/
  ├── pom.xml
  ├── src/main/java/
  │   └── com/example/
  │       ├── MyWebApp.java
  │       └── util/
  │           └── StringUtil.java
  ├── src/main/webapp/
  │   └── index.jsp
  └── web.xml
```

**Explanation:**

* `pom.xml`: This file defines the project's dependencies using Maven (a popular build tool).
* `src/main/java`: This directory contains the source code for your Java classes.
    * `com/example`: This package contains your application's Java classes.
        * `MyWebApp.java`: This is the main class for your web application.
        * `util/`: This sub-package contains utility classes.
            * `StringUtil.java`: This is a sample utility class with String manipulation methods.
* `src/main/webapp`: This directory contains web resources like JSP pages.
    * `index.jsp`: This is the main JSP page for your web application.
* `web.xml`: This deployment descriptor configures your web application for the server.

**JAR Dependency:**

In this example, we'll assume you have a JAR file named `string-util.jar` containing helper methods for string manipulation. This JAR is not included in the project by default and needs to be declared as a dependency in `pom.xml`.

**pom.xml (example):**

```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-web-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.external</groupId>
      <artifactId>string-util</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

</project>
```

**MyWebApp.java (example):**

```java
package com.example;

import com.example.util.StringUtil;

public class MyWebApp {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Simulate a web request and use StringUtil from the JAR
    String name = "John Doe";
    String reversedName = StringUtil.reverseString(name);
    System.out.println("Reversed name: " + reversedName);
  }
}
```

**index.jsp (example):**

```jsp
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my Web App!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**web.xml (basic configuration):**

```xml
<web-app>
  <display-name>My Web App</display-name>
  </web.xml>
```

**Running the Application:**

1.  Make sure you have `maven` installed ([https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)).
2.  Open a terminal in the project directory (`my-web-app`).
3.  Run `mvn package` to build the project and create a WAR file (web application archive).
4.  Deploy the WAR file to a web server like Tomcat ([https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)).
5.  Access the application in your browser according to your server configuration (usually `http://localhost:<port>/index.jsp`).

**Note:** This is a basic example. A real web application would involve servlets, JSP pages with more functionalities, and proper database interaction. This demonstrates how to use a JAR dependency within a Java web application project.

Sure, here's the `StringUtil.java` class with a sample reverseString method:

```java
package com.example.util;

public class StringUtil {

  public static String reverseString(String str) {
    if (str == null) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input String cannot be null");
    }
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      sb.append(str.charAt(i));
    }
    return sb.toString();
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* This class defines a static method `reverseString` that takes a String as input and returns the reversed String.
* The method checks for null input and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if encountered.
* It uses a `StringBuilder` object to efficiently build the reversed String.
* The loop iterates through the original String in reverse order, appending each character to the `StringBuilder`.
* Finally, the `StringBuilder.toString()` method converts the internal character buffer to a String and returns it.

**Note:** This is a simple example. The `string-util.jar` might contain various other methods for String manipulation depending on the specific library you're using.

The build steps for this Java web application project involve using Maven, a popular build tool for Java projects. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**1. Install Maven:**

* If you haven't already, download and install Maven from the official website [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

**2. Build the project:**

* Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project (`my-web-app`).
* Run the following command to build the project:

```bash
mvn package
```

* This command instructs Maven to process the `pom.xml` file and perform the following actions:
    * Download any dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` file (including `string-util.jar` if it's available in a public repository).
    * Compile your Java source code (`MyWebApp.java` and `StringUtil.java`) from `src/main/java` into class files (`.class`) and store them in the `target/classes` directory.
    * Package the compiled class files, along with other resources like JSP pages (`index.jsp`) and the deployment descriptor (`web.xml`), into a Web Application Archive (WAR) file named after your project with `.war` extension (usually `my-web-app.war`).  The WAR file is placed in the `target` directory.

**3. Deploy the application:**

* The built WAR file (`my-web-app.war`) is ready for deployment to a web server like Tomcat.
*  Each web server has its own deployment process. You'll need to refer to the specific documentation for your chosen server.

**Additional Notes:**

* Maven provides various other commands for different build tasks. You can explore the available options using `mvn help:effective-goal`.
* If the `string-util.jar` is not available in a public repository, you'll need to place it manually in your local Maven repository or within your project structure for Maven to find it during the build process. 

Here's how to initialize a new project using Maven:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Java:** Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can verify by running `java -version` in your terminal.
* **Maven:** Download and install Maven from the official website [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

**Steps:**

1. **Open Terminal:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project.

2. **Run Maven Archetype Command:** Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing placeholders with your desired values:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DgroupId=com.yourcompany.group \  # Replace with your company or group ID
  -DartifactId=your-project-name \  # Replace with your desired project name
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.4  # You can use a different archetype version if needed
```

**Explanation of arguments:**

* `mvn archetype:generate`: This tells Maven to use the archetype plugin to generate a new project.
* `-DgroupId`: This specifies the groupId for your project, typically your company or organization's domain reversed (e.g., com.mycompany). 
* `-DartifactId`: This defines the artifactId, which is the unique identifier for your project within a groupId.
* `-DarchetypeArtifactId`: This specifies the archetype to use for project creation. `maven-archetype-quickstart` is a basic archetype for Java projects.
* `-DarchetypeVersion`: This defines the version of the archetype to use. You can explore other available archetypes with `mvn archetype:list`.

3. **Interactive Mode (Optional):**

If you run the command for the first time, Maven might prompt you with interactive questions to gather details about the project. You can answer these or use the `-DinteractiveMode=false` option in the command to avoid them.

4. **Project Creation:**

Once you execute the command, Maven will download any necessary artifacts and create a new project directory with the specified `artifactId`. The project structure will follow standard Maven conventions with directories for source code (`src/main/java`), resources (`src/main/resources`), and a project configuration file (`pom.xml`).

This creates a basic Maven project structure to get you started. You can further customize it by editing the `pom.xml` file to add dependencies, configure build tasks, and other project-specific settings.
