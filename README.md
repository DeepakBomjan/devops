## Github CICD Best Practices
## Changelog Best Practices
### Guiding Principles
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

#### Types of changes

*Added* for new features.
*Changed* for changes in existing functionality.
*Deprecated* for soon-to-be removed features.
*Removed* for now removed features.
*Fixed* for any bug fixes.
*Security* in case of vulnerabilities.

### Automatic Version Bump
The following three actions can be used to implement automatic version bump:
- mathieudutour/github-tag-action
- anothrNick/github-tag-action
- haya14busa/action-bumpr
