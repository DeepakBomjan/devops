To remove a large file from tracking and Git history (if it has already been committed), and then push the changes, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Stop tracking the file with Git LFS (if previously tracked with LFS).**
2. **Remove the file from Git history.**
3. **Update the repository.**

Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to do this:

### 1. Stop Tracking the File with Git LFS (if applicable)

If you have added the file to Git LFS, you need to stop tracking it.

```sh
git lfs untrack "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
```

### 2. Remove the File from Git History

You need to remove the file from the Git history. This can be done using the `git filter-repo` tool or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`.

#### Using `git filter-repo`:

First, install `git filter-repo` (if not already installed).

```sh
# Using Homebrew on macOS
brew install git-filter-repo

# Or download and install from the official GitHub repository
# https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo
```

Then run the following commands:

```sh
git filter-repo --path "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5" --invert-paths
```

#### Using BFG Repo-Cleaner:

First, download and install BFG Repo-Cleaner from the [official site](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).

Then run the following commands:

```sh
# Replace the large file path as needed
bfg --delete-files "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"

# Cleanup and prune the repository
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

### 3. Update the Repository

After removing the file from history, you need to commit and push the changes.

#### Steps:

1. **Remove the file locally:**

   ```sh
   git rm --cached "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   ```

2. **Commit the changes:**

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Remove large file from repository"
   ```

3. **Force push the cleaned repository to the remote:**

   **Warning:** This will overwrite the remote history. Ensure this is coordinated with your team if others are working on the same repository.

   ```sh
   git push origin --force --all
   git push origin --force --tags
   ```

### Full Example Workflow

Here's a complete workflow using `git filter-repo`:

1. **Install `git filter-repo`:**

   ```sh
   brew install git-filter-repo
   ```

2. **Remove the file from history:**

   ```sh
   git filter-repo --path "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5" --invert-paths
   ```

3. **Remove the file locally:**

   ```sh
   git rm --cached "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   ```

4. **Commit the changes:**

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Remove large file from repository"
   ```

5. **Force push the cleaned repository to the remote:**

   ```sh
   git push origin --force --all
   git push origin --force --tags
   ```

This will remove the large file from the repository and its history, and push the changes to the remote repository.
