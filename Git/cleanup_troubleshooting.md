To amend the commit and remove the large file, you can use `git rebase -i` to interactively rebase to the commit before the one you want to amend, and then remove the file and amend the commit. Here are the steps to do this:

### Steps to Amend the Commit and Remove the File

1. **Start an Interactive Rebase:**

   Start an interactive rebase to the parent commit of the one you want to amend.

   ```sh
   git rebase -i c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be^
   ```

2. **Mark the Commit for Editing:**

   In the interactive rebase editor, change `pick` to `edit` for the commit `c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be` (the one you want to amend).

   ```
   edit c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be all hol
   pick fa8109cda15570c04db220a3935493f1441fe7bc cleanup
   ```

   Save and exit the editor.

3. **Remove the File and Amend the Commit:**

   Now, Git will pause at the commit you marked for editing. Remove the large file and amend the commit.

   ```sh
   git rm --cached "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```

4. **Continue the Rebase:**

   Continue the rebase process.

   ```sh
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   If there are other commits that need to be rebased, Git will apply them automatically. If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually and then continue the rebase.

5. **Force Push the Changes:**

   Finally, force push the changes to the remote repository. Note that this will overwrite the remote history, so ensure this is coordinated with your team.

   ```sh
   git push origin --force
   ```

### Example Workflow

1. **Start the interactive rebase:**

   ```sh
   git rebase -i c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be^
   ```

2. **In the editor, mark the commit for editing:**

   Change the line from:

   ```
   pick c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be all hol
   pick fa8109cda15570c04db220a3935493f1441fe7bc cleanup
   ```

   To:

   ```
   edit c627f9ca056f68fe10233792583d1463bdf915be all hol
   pick fa8109cda15570c04db220a3935493f1441fe7bc cleanup
   ```

3. **Remove the file and amend the commit:**

   ```sh
   git rm --cached "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```

4. **Continue the rebase:**

   ```sh
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Force push the changes:**

   ```sh
   git push origin --force
   ```

By following these steps, you will have removed the large file from the specified commit and updated the history accordingly.
