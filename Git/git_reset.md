Certainly! Let's go through `git reset` with both `--soft` and `--hard` options, and then we'll cover how to revert after a `--soft` reset.

### Git Reset with `--soft` Option

1. **Example Scenario**:
   Suppose you have a repository with the following commit history:

   ```
   * c2f7a9d (HEAD -> main) Updated README.md
   * 35b03af Added new feature
   * 8c3b2d1 Initial commit
   ```

2. **Performing a `--soft` Reset**:
   If you want to undo the last commit (`c2f7a9d`) but keep its changes staged (not committed), you can use `git reset --soft HEAD~1`:

   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```

   This command moves the `HEAD` pointer of your current branch (`main`) back one commit (`HEAD~1`), but keeps the changes from the undone commit (`c2f7a9d`) staged. Your commit history now looks like this:

   ```
   * c2f7a9d Updated README.md
   * 35b03af Added new feature
   * 8c3b2d1 Initial commit
   ```

   However, the changes introduced by `c2f7a9d` are now staged and ready to be committed again.

### Git Reset with `--hard` Option

1. **Example Scenario**:
   Let's continue from the previous scenario where you have performed a `--soft` reset:

   ```
   * c2f7a9d (HEAD -> main) Updated README.md (Staged changes)
   * 35b03af Added new feature
   * 8c3b2d1 Initial commit
   ```

2. **Performing a `--hard` Reset**:
   If you want to completely remove the last commit (`c2f7a9d`) and all its changes from your working directory and staging area, you can use `git reset --hard HEAD~1`:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

   This command resets `HEAD` to the previous commit (`HEAD~1`), effectively removing the last commit (`c2f7a9d`) entirely. After a `--hard` reset, your commit history will look like this:

   ```
   * 35b03af Added new feature
   * 8c3b2d1 Initial commit
   ```

   The changes introduced by `c2f7a9d` are completely removed from your working directory and staging area.

### Reverting after a `--soft` Reset

After performing a `--soft` reset, the changes from the reverted commit are staged but not committed. To revert this reset and restore the commit as it was before the reset, you can use `git reset HEAD@{1}` followed by `git commit`:

1. **Identify the commit hash**: After the `--soft` reset, use `git reflog` to find the hash of the commit before the reset. It's typically `HEAD@{1}` if no other operations have been performed.

2. **Revert the reset**: Use `git reset HEAD@{1}` to move `HEAD` back to the commit before the reset:

   ```bash
   git reset HEAD@{1}
   ```

   This will restore the staging area to how it was immediately after the `--soft` reset.

3. **Commit the changes**: Now, commit these changes to reinstate the commit that was reverted:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Reverting previous reset"
   ```

This process effectively undoes the `--soft` reset and re-establishes the commit and its changes as they were before the reset operation.
