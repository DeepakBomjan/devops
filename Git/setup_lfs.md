The error you're seeing is because GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB for individual files. The file `IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5` exceeds this limit. To resolve this issue, you can use Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle large files.

### Steps to Use Git LFS for Large Files

1. **Install Git LFS:**
   If Git LFS is not already installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Git LFS website](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repository:**
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

3. **Track the Large File(s):**
   Tell Git LFS to track the large file(s). Replace the path with the path to your large file:
   ```sh
   git lfs track "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   ```

4. **Add the .gitattributes File:**
   The `git lfs track` command adds a line to a `.gitattributes` file, which you need to commit:
   ```sh
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

5. **Commit the Large File(s):**
   Add and commit the large file(s) as usual:
   ```sh
   git add IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5
   git commit -m "Add large file using Git LFS"
   ```

6. **Push the Changes:**
   Push your changes, including the large files, to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin git-hol
   ```

### Full Example

Hereâ€™s the full sequence of commands:

1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed):**
   Follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Git LFS installation page](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

2. **Initialize Git LFS in your repository:**
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   ```

3. **Track the large file(s):**
   ```sh
   git lfs track "IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5"
   ```

4. **Add the .gitattributes file:**
   ```sh
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

5. **Commit the changes:**
   ```sh
   git add IaC/Terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.31.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.31.0_x5
   git commit -m "Add large file using Git LFS"
   ```

6. **Push the changes:**
   ```sh
   git push origin git-hol
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to push to the remote repository.
- If there are multiple large files, you can track all of them using `git lfs track "path/to/large/file"` for each file.
- Once tracked by Git LFS, subsequent pushes and pulls will handle the large files using LFS, which bypasses GitHub's regular file size limits.
